As media ecosystems in West Africa diversify and open after decades of state control, innovative and independent journalism is advancing government transparency and accountability. New opportunities for funders are opening in tandem, with potential for both social and economic impact. Reboot explored several of these opportunities through in-depth research in Nigeria and Ghana.

##Landscape snapshot

Traditionally, trust in the media in the region is low. Citizens view most media as political instruments, frequently biased and easily corruptible. Many media organizations, for their part, compromise editorial independence to survive, and resort to lowest-common-denominator content to drive traffic.

This mistrust has led to a wholehearted embrace of new and social media tools. Citizens are seeking alternative views, contributing their perspectives, and redefining popular media narratives on platforms which are not beholden to elites.

Their participation has led to a dramatic reshaping of the dynamics between citizens, media, and government.

- Citizen voices on social media are reshaping media: Media faces competitive pressure from social media to deliver critical examinations of official narratives.

- Media is influencing politics and government: Spurred by audience demand and contributions, media is increasingly uncovering corruption and holding leaders accountable to their promises.

- Government response is driving more citizen engagement: Citizens continue to contribute the media dialogue to the extent that they see governments held accountable.

The historic 2015 Nigerian general election demonstrates this virtuous cycle. Citizens photographed polling results, compared them to the official government results, and discussed on social media. Their evidence spread across new and traditional media, giving their contributions audience and influence, which in turn incentivized more citizen participation.

Despite citizens’ critical role in reshaping media and improving governance, few organizations are leveraging them for both social impact and financial sustainability. Beyond the low-hanging fruit of elections and major corruption scandals, citizen energy remains largely untapped.

Interested funders should focus on two key opportunity areas:

##Opportunity Area 1: Activated Audiences as the key leverage point
Media’s impact on governance and financial stability both hinge on audience engagement. Few people leap straight from reading the news to taking political action, but they can be pushed through increasing engagement levels…
